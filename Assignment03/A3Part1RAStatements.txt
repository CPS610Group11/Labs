Step 5:

project (StudentName, CourseName) ((Engineering_Enrolled join(StudentNo) Science_Enrolled) natjoin Central_Student natjoin Central_Courses)

Step 6:

project (StudentName) (select(GPA >= 4) (Science_Student join(StudentNo) Engineering_Student))

Step 7:

project (CourseName, Average(GPA)) (groupby(CourseName) (Central_Enrolled natjoin Central_Student natjoin Central_Course))

Step 8:

project (ProfName) (project(CourseNo, ProfName) (Central_Teaches) - project(CourseNo, ProfName) (Central_Can_Teach))

Step 9:

project (ProfName, EngOffice, SciOffice) (Central_Professor natjoin Engineering_Can_Teach natjoin Science_Can_Teach)

Step 10:

project (CourseName) (select(Credits = 1) (Central_Course))
